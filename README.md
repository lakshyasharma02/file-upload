# File Upload using React and Express

A simple project showcasing how to upload files from the frontend to the server. Used ReactJS for the frontend with Materialize CSS and Node.js & express.js with express-fileupload package for the backend.i
(Couldn't figure out how to style file inputs :p)

#### Functioning

The user can select any file on their PC once they click on Choose File. After selecting the file, clicking on upload will send the file to the server and a JSON response will be sent to the frontend. 
A GIF showing the functioning can be found below.
