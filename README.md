# File Upload using React and Express

A simple project showcasing how to upload files from the frontend to the server. Used **ReactJS** for the frontend with Materialize CSS and **Node.js** & express.js with **express-fileupload** package for the backend.
(Couldn't figure out how to style file inputs :p)

### Functioning

The user can select any file on their PC once they click on Choose File. After selecting the file, clicking on upload will send the file to the server and a JSON response will be sent to the frontend. 

Since I didn't have access to a server, I have used my PC as the frontend and the server. Once a file is uploaded, it will be viewed in the directory I have assigned as the server.
